eVTOL Energy Consumption
===================================

   
Overview
--------

The objective of this project is to forecast the daily energy demand at charging stations of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operations. The method we develop here to forecasting charging demand takes into account key factors influencing energy consumption in UAM, including the aircraft model, wind forecasts, mission flight plans, and flight demands over a specified forecast period.
